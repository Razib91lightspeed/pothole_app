# 📱 DropDetection – Real-Time Motion & Drop Detection App

DropDetection is a SwiftUI-based iOS app that monitors phone movement, detects sudden drops or jolts, and logs real-time accelerometer and GPS data. This app was developed by **Razib Hasan** as part of an internship project at **Solit**, focused on mobile sensing and infrastructure awareness.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time motion detection using CoreMotion  
- ✅ Shows whether the phone is in motion or stationary  
- ✅ Detects sudden drops/jolts using magnitude thresholds  
- ✅ Logs the latest 20 accelerometer readings with:
  - Timestamp (date & time)
  - Motion magnitude
  - GPS latitude & longitude  
- ✅ Clean SwiftUI-based UI with large animated Start/Stop button  
- ✅ Runs on real devices with Apple Developer ID setup
